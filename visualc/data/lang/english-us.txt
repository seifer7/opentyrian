DATACUBE_1_1_BODY       :AAfter gathering all the available data, I think I've found the safest course into Tyrian orbit from my landing platform...|After heading due west out of the Fauchi mines you should come in contact with the floating battle platforms. Watch for the auto targeting plasma turrets and especially the ~construction~ ~claws~. |Whoever designed these platforms sure counted on spies and infiltrators, as they're loaded with small squadrons of surface ~attack~ ~drones~ as well. |I think these platforms are filled with ~Gravitic Ore~, which would explain why they're floating. No wonder ~Microsol~ wants to mine them so badly. I just hope I don't get intercepted before I reach orbit.
